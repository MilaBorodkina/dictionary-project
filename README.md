# Dictionary Project

This dictionary app was a project for an advanced React coding workshop. I improved my skills in React.js, Bootstrap, real-life development workflow using Git and GitHub, and hosting on Netlify. My dictionary app connects to APIs to fetch and display definitions, synonyms, and examples. It also has an audio pronunciation feature. The app is user-friendly and responsive so users can effortlessly explore anything they want.
